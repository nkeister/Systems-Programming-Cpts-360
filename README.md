Steps to run file
1. run any of the executable scripts "lvl2, run, mk, s, disks"
      - depends on what the script does
      - "disks" creates new disk images
2. run executable "./runthis (disk image)"
3. file system should work

NOTES:
1. disk1 created empty file and does not mkdir inside of another file. idk why thus far
2. cat huge does not cat entire file
